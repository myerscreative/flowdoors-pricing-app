## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for the Next Feature?

When you're ready, just say:

**"Let's add lead assignment next"**

And paste this in Cursor:
```

@docs/redesign/Lead_Assignment_Feature_Guide.md

Now that the admin redesign is complete, let's add lead assignment:

1. Add User type and assignedTo field to Lead
2. Create AssignmentBadge component
3. Create AssignmentDropdown component
4. Update LeadsTable with Assignment column
5. Add Assignment filter
6. Add 5th stat card for Unassigned leads

Use the same design patterns from the admin redesign we just completed.
Show me the implementation plan first.
