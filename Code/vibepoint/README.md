# Vibepoint

**A mood mapping app that helps you understand and control your emotional states**

## Overview

Vibepoint is a personal mood tracking application that uses an intuitive gradient interface to help users map their emotional state and discover the mental patterns that create their moods.

### How It Works

1. **Select Your Mood**: Tap anywhere on a color gradient that represents your current emotional state
   - Vertical axis: Happy (top) ↔ Unhappy (bottom)
   - Horizontal axis: Unmotivated (left) ↔ Motivated (right)

2. **Answer Three Questions**:
   - What are you focusing on?
   - What are you telling yourself?
   - What physical sensations are you experiencing?

3. **Discover Your Patterns**: Over time, Vibepoint analyzes your entries and reveals the correlations between your thoughts, focus, physical state, and your moods.

### The Goal

Vibepoint teaches you that moods aren't random or beyond your control. By tracking what you focus on, what you tell yourself, and what you feel physically, you learn to recognize and adjust the mental habits that shape your emotional experience.
