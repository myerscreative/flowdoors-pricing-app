# VibePoint — Onboarding Screens (Tony Robbins Style)

---

## Screen 1 — The Wake-Up
**Master Your Emotions. Master Your Life.**  
Your emotions don’t “just happen.” They’re created by patterns you can learn to control.

---

## Screen 2 — The Power
**Every Emotion Has a Recipe.**  
Your focus, your self-talk, and your physiology combine to create how you feel.  
Change the ingredients → change the state.

---

## Screen 3 — The Clarity
**Stop Guessing. Start Understanding.**  
VibePoint helps you see the real source of your emotions —  
so you can shift them with intention.

---

## Screen 4 — The Breakthrough
**This Isn’t a Mood Tracker.**  
It’s a state-mastery tool.  
No labels, no judgment, no emotional “diaries.”  
Just clarity, choice, and power.

## Screen 5 — The Invitation
**Ready to Take Control?**  
Tap the map, track your emotional ingredients, and build unstoppable inner strength.  
Let’s begin.
