## Full Description

Most apps ask you to label how you feel.  
VibePoint shows you how to **change** it.

Your emotions don’t “just happen.”  
They’re created by three ingredients:

- **Your Focus:** the pictures and scenarios in your mind  
- **Your Self-Talk:** the words and tone you use internally  
- **Your Physiology:** your breathing, posture, and body cues  

These ingredients combine into emotional patterns.  
And when you understand the pattern, you can shift the state.

VibePoint isn’t a mood diary.  
It’s a pattern-recognition and state-mastery tool.

Tap your mood on a visual emotional map, identify your three ingredients, and unlock insights that reveal your emotional patterns over time.

Stop replaying old emotional stories.  
Start designing the emotional life you want.

VibePoint.  
**Emotional power made simple.**
