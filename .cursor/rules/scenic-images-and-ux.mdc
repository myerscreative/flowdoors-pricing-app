# Images & UX

## Images
- Use Next `<Image />` for local/static assets
- For dynamic/external sources where `<Image />` is not viable, document why and add a **targeted** disable for the `no-img-element` rule

## UX Consistency
- Apple-clean aesthetic for quoting UI
- Keep rounded corners and clean spacing
- Avoid drive-by visual changes in lint/type fixes
