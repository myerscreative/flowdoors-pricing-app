# FlowDoors Design System Rules

## Core Principles

When implementing designs, always reference:

- docs/redesign/ for mockups and guides
- Use FlowDoors colors: #00aeef (blue), #8dc63f (green), #2e2e2e (charcoal)
- Follow Next.js 15 and TypeScript best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Make all components mobile responsive (test at 320px, 768px, 1024px)

## Brand Colors

Primary Blue: #00aeef (FlowDoors Blue)

- Use for: Primary CTAs, links, active states, focus rings
- Hover: #0097d1
- Light: rgba(0, 174, 239, 0.1)

Success Green: #8dc63f (FlowDoors Green)

- Use for: Success states, positive indicators, trust badges
- Hover: #7ab82f
- Light: rgba(141, 198, 63, 0.1)

Charcoal: #2e2e2e (FlowDoors Charcoal)

- Use for: Primary text, headings, important content
- Never use pure black (#000000)

## Component Guidelines

- All buttons should have hover and focus states
- Use consistent spacing: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
- Border radius: 8px (inputs), 12px (cards), 16px (large cards)
- Shadows: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05) for subtle, 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) for prominent
- Font sizes: 48px (hero numbers), 24px (section headers), 16px (body), 14px (small), 12px (tiny)

## File References

### Admin Redesign:

- docs/redesign/Admin_Leads_Implementation_Guide.md
- docs/redesign/FlowDoors_Admin_Leads_Redesign.html
- Components: LeadStatsCards, LeadFilters, LeadsTable, AssignmentDropdown

### Quote Page:

- docs/redesign/Quote_Summary_Redesign_Analysis.md
- docs/redesign/FlowDoors_Quote_Summary_Redesign.html
- Components: ProgressBar, QuoteSummaryCard, ServiceToggle

### Forms:

- docs/redesign/Audience_Optimized_Implementation_Guide.md
- Use HomeownerConversationalForm for main site
- Use ContractorQuickQuote for /contractor-quote page

## Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use 'use client' directive for interactive components
- Prefer function components over class components
- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except in loops)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle loading and error states

## Mobile Requirements

- Touch targets minimum 44px √ó 44px (preferably 48px)
- Test on iPhone SE (375px), iPad (768px), Desktop (1280px)
- Stack columns vertically on mobile
- Use responsive text sizes (text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg)
- Ensure dropdowns work well on touch devices

## Accessibility

- Include proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation must work (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Focus states must be visible
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Alt text for all images

## Performance

- Lazy load images
- Use Next.js Image component
- Minimize bundle size (check with 'npm run analyze' if available)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (use React.memo when appropriate)

## When Creating New Components:

1. Check if similar component exists first
2. Place in appropriate directory (admin/, quote/, forms/)
3. Export from index.ts for easy imports
4. Include TypeScript props interface
5. Add display name for debugging
6. Make mobile responsive by default

## When Updating Existing Components:

1. Review current implementation first
2. Maintain backward compatibility if possible
3. Update related components if needed
4. Test on all breakpoints
5. Verify no TypeScript errors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- ‚ùå Don't use arbitrary Tailwind values unless necessary
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode colors (use Tailwind color classes)
- ‚ùå Don't forget mobile responsive classes
- ‚ùå Don't use px values in Tailwind (use spacing scale)
- ‚ùå Don't forget to handle loading/error states
- ‚ùå Don't use inline styles (use Tailwind classes)

## Before Committing:

- Run TypeScript check: npm run typecheck
- Run linter: npm run lint
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Verify all imports are correct
- Check console for errors
- Test in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

```

## üéØ **But Your Current Version is Great!**

Your current `.cursorrules` is **totally fine** and will work well. The expanded version above is just if you want to be more thorough.

**Your current rules will:**
- ‚úÖ Tell Cursor to always use FlowDoors colors
- ‚úÖ Point to the right documentation
- ‚úÖ Enforce mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Keep TypeScript/Tailwind best practices

---

## üöÄ **Test It Now**

Open Cursor Composer (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`) and try:
```

Create a simple test component that uses our FlowDoors design system.

Make a button with:

- FlowDoors blue background
- Proper hover state
- Mobile responsive
- Follows our .cursorrules

```

Cursor should automatically:
- Use `#00aeef` for the button
- Add a hover state with `#0097d1`
- Make it mobile responsive
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Follow TypeScript best practices

---

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

Your setup is perfect! Now you can:

**1. Start implementing:**
```

Cmd/Ctrl + I

@docs/redesign/Admin_Leads_Implementation_Guide.md

Let's implement the admin leads page redesign.
Start with Phase 1: LeadStatsCards component.

Follow the .cursorrules for colors and styling.
