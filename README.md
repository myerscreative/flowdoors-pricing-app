## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vibepoint
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

4. Set up the database (see Database Schema section below)

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Schema

You need to create the following tables in your Supabase project:

### `mood_entries` table

```sql
create table mood_entries (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  mood_x numeric not null check (mood_x >= 0 and mood_x <= 100),
  mood_y numeric not null check (mood_y >= 0 and mood_y <= 100),
  focus text not null,
  self_talk text not null,
  physical text not null,
  notes text
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table mood_entries enable row level security;

-- Create policies
create policy "Users can view their own mood entries"
  on mood_entries for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can insert their own mood entries"
  on mood_entries for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own mood entries"
  on mood_entries for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can delete their own mood entries"
  on mood_entries for delete
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create index for better query performance
create index mood_entries_user_id_created_at_idx
  on mood_entries (user_id, created_at desc);
```

### `user_preferences` table

```sql
create table user_preferences (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null unique,
  onboarding_completed boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table user_preferences enable row level security;

-- Create policies
create policy "Users can view their own preferences"
  on user_preferences for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can insert their own preferences"
  on user_preferences for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own preferences"
  on user_preferences for update
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
